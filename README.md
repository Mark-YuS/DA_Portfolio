**Data Integration via MySQL Database Creation and Complex SQL queries for Data Analysis**

- Coordinated the integration of extensive datasets from six distinct CSV files, compiling data related to 1.32 million users, Yelp reviews, platform check-ins, and business projections.
- Skillfully processed and organized the raw data into a structured and scalable MySQL database, enhancing data accessibility and facilitating efficient analysis.
- Demonstrated proficiency in SQL through the use of CTE and complex conditional logic to perform exploratory data analysis and extract critical insights. Applied sophisticated data manipulation strategies including subqueries and case statements to drive strategic business decisions.

**Sentiment Analysis for Enhanced Business Ratings**

- Leveraged Python to conduct sentiment analysis on a massive corpus of 5.26 million reviews, employing cutting-edge feature vectorization and advanced text mining techniques.
- Enabled businesses to gain a deeper understanding of customer sentiment and make data-backed decisions to improve user experiences.

**Enhancing Business Outcomes through Strategic Data Analysis**
- Utilized Python to conduct thorough exploratory data analysis, uncovering initial insights and trends that guide deeper investigations into user behavior.
-  Employed Folium to create interactive heatmaps, visually representing data to better understand geographic trends and user and restaurants distributions.
-  Analyzed the findings to extract actionable insights, resulting in a comprehensive report that not only outlined strategies for improving elite user retention but also addressed overall business performance improvements, customer engagement enhancements, and operational optimizations, effectively guiding future business strategies and efforts.

**Collaborated with Engineering Teams and Delivered Winning A/B Tests**

- Applied statistical techniques to guarantee the experiments were methodically planned, randomized, and statistically valid, yielding results that could inform decision-making.
- Implemented a series of A/B testing experiments to validate the effectiveness of the UI changes on user preferences, leading to make a data-driven decision. 

**Utilized Fine-Tuned Logistic Regression for Launch Probability Assessment**

- Developed and fine-tuned a  Logistic Regression model to assess the probability of successfully launching the UI changes.
- Delivered in-depth customer insights by interpreting the model results, enabling data-driven decision-making for the product development and marketing teams.

**Driving Operational Efficiency with Data-Driven Insights**

- Demonstrated a deep understanding of user behavior patterns and preferences. 
- Acted on data-driven insights to make informed decisions on refining the product recommendation system and aligning it with user expectations.
- Conducted thorough data analysis to identify correlations between UI changes and operational efficiencies, empowering stakeholders to prioritize initiatives effectively.

**Sophisticated Data Analysis**
- Employ advanced data analysis techniques to enhance understanding of transaction patterns and support model optimization.
- Utilize **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib**, powerful Python libraries, for creating detailed and informative visualizations that clearly illustrate transaction trends.
- Use visualizations to identify seasonal effects, cyclical patterns, and anomalies within the data, aiding intuitive and hypothesis-driven data exploration.
- Perform time series decomposition to break down transaction data into trend, seasonal, and residual components, providing clear insights into underlying structures.
- Conduct correlation analysis using visual tools to assess relationships between various features within the dataset.


**Comparative Analysis of Deep Learning and ARIMA Models for Forecasting**
- Utilize grid search to identify the optimal parameters for constructing the ARIMA model, ensuring the best possible fit for the data.
- Employ Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) as the evaluation metric to measure the accuracy of the ARIMA model's forecasts.
- Develop a univariate multi-step LSTM model to train and predict future data points, focusing on single-variable time series forecasting.
- Contrast the performance of the ARIMA model with the LSTM model to determine strengths and weaknesses of each in handling different aspects of the forecasting task.
