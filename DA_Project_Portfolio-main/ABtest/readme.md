## Project Background

The goal of the project was to enhance the e-commerce landing page to boost the conversion rate. To assess the effectiveness of the new landing page compared to the existing one, we carried out an A/B test and Logistic Regression model. This test aimed to inform our decision on whether to permanently switch to the new page, stick with the old version, or prolong the testing phase to gather more data.

## Project Benefits

Through this A/B test, we achieved significant outcomes:

- User Experience Enhancement: Utilizing data-driven A/B testing enabled us to gather crucial insights into whether the redesigned page could enhance the user experience and boost the user conversion rate. This information allowed us to make informed adjustments to the page design as needed.
- Accurate Launch Probability Assessment: The creation and refinement of a Logistic Regression model helped us accurately predict the success of implementing UI changes. This model incorporated various factors specific to users and their historical engagement, allowing for precise forecasts.
- Data-Driven Decision-Making: Through the analysis of model outcomes, we gained valuable insights into customer behavior, facilitating a data-informed approach to shaping product development and marketing tactics. These insights were instrumental in guiding strategic discussions regarding the rollout of UI modifications.

## Project Overview

This project included the following key steps:

1. **Probability-Based Approach:**
   - This phase entailed calculating the chances that a user would land on either the new or old page, aiming to understand the distribution of user experiences without making any initial assumptions.
   - It provided a foundational understanding of user page interactions from a probability standpoint.
     
2. **A/B Test Approach:**
   - Here, we formulated a hypothesis to see if the new page indeed leads to an improvement in conversion rates.
   - By comparing conversion outcomes between simulated user groups, we evaluated the effectiveness of the new page, using the p-value to gauge the statistical significance of our observations.
   - This phase also considered alternative analyses to reinforce our decision on whether the observed data justified a departure from the initial assumptions.

3. **Regression Approach:**
   - The regression approach explores two possible outcomes: whether the new page is better or not.
   - It goes beyond simple A/B testing by incorporating geographic location as a variable to assess if conversion rate are significantly different in different country. 
   - Regression analysis allows us to identify potential factors influencing user behavior and conversion, providing a more comprehensive view of the data.

Each of these approaches offers a distinct perspective on evaluating the effectiveness of the new page, with the probability-based approach focusing on likelihood, the A/B test approach emphasizing statistical significance, and the regression approach dive into potential influencing factors. Depending on the specific goals and available data, one or a combination of these approaches may be chosen to draw meaningful conclusions.


## Summary

In the e-commerce landing page A/B test project, the company assesses if the new page design boosts user satisfaction and increases conversion rates. This enables a data-driven determination on launching the new design or continuing to refine the pageâ€”a crucial choice for enhancing the company's revenue.
